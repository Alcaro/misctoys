Configuring Postfix to reject spam on Debian using a SpamAssassin milter
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want Postfix to reject spam. And I want it rejected at the SMTP level, not a backscatter bounce.
This was surprisingly annoying to google.

This guide assumes Postfix is already installed and configured.

1) Ignore other guides, most of them seem to yield backscatter

2) Install SpamAssassin: apt-get install spamass-milter

3) Teach Postfix what SpamAssassin is: append this to /etc/postfix/master.cf:
spamassassin unix -     n       n       -       -       pipe
  user=debian-spamd argv=/usr/bin/spamc -f -e /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f ${sender} ${recipient}
(may be done automatically by the apt-get script, not sure)

4) Tell Postfix to use the milter: append to /etc/postfix/main.cf:
smtpd_milters = unix:/spamass/spamass.sock
milter_connect_macros = j {daemon_name} v {if_name} _
milter_default_action = tempfail

5) If you've chmodded /etc/postfix/ to anything other than 755, ensure user debian-spamd:nobody can
access it. You can change the username in master.cf, or set username to user=debian-spamd:some-group,
but it rejects group postfix. Easiest shitty workaround: Set spamd as owner, chmod to 550, hope
nobody else needs to read there.

6) If you've got a strictly configured firewall, ensure debian-spamd and spamass-milter can access
127.0.0.1:783/TCP
(pretty sure only one of them need that port, but too lazy to figure out which)
