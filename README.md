This repository is for small items that don't have anything to do with any of my other projects, and which are too small to have their own repositories.

Unless otherwise specified, you are allowed to use any and all files in this repo for any purpose, as long as you make it clear that these files (or any modified version of them) are from here.
Unless otherwise specified, there is absolutely no warranty, support, or anything similar for anything in this repo. You're on your own if it breaks or is useless.
