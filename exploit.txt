Hey, what's up? I got an idea for you.  You're like a genius when it comes to cracking computer
security, right?  Well, I totally know what you should do.

You know Locha?  That dictatorship or whatever in the middle of the ocean?  They've got this big-ass
firewall keeping their people from seeing stuff on the internet about how they're oppressed and junk.

You should totally crack into it, look around, spread some freedom up in there.  Screwing up
people's websites and stealing Facebook passwords is for kids.  You got to fight the power!  That's
what a real white-hat computer cracker does.  Dispense some good old American freedom.

Just try not to bomb anyone or anything. :)

P.S.: By the way, I talked to a friend of mine who runs a zombie bot net.  He's willing to run one
Distributed Denial of Service on a system.  So if you have a ton of trouble cracking a system, just
use your DDOS.  But you only get one, so use it wisely, all right?



Barrier Firewall Tier 0:
  The island nation of Locha is cut off from much of the Internet by the "Barrier Firewall," a
  government-mandated censor designed to curtail any online political dissent.

WASHINGTON, D.C.

In a press conference at the White House today, the U.S. Department of State announced that it has
added the island nation of Locha to its list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.  State Department
representatives cited the 2009 hijacking of the oil tanker Hiigara and last month's car bombing in
Bangaluru, India as specific incidents in which the Lochan government is believed to have been
directly involved.

The Lochan government does not act with the will of its people when it assists in these deplorable
acts," said State Department representative Chell Johnson.  "The government in Lioa has repeatedly
refused to cooperate in investigations of these events, and has publicly announced approval of the
acts, which it claims were perpetuated by independent agents unaffiliated with the Lochan government."

The State Department has long maintained that the Lochan government should be replaced in a free and
open democratic election.  The current ruling party has been in control since the 1974 coup that
overthrew the last King of Locha, Tio IV.

The Lochan government has yet to issue a public response to this announcement.  As a consequence of
the designation, several financial and diplomatic restrictions will be placed upon U.S. trade and
communication with the nation.

Barrier Firewall Tier 1:
  Using the Barrier Firewall, the totalitarian government of Locha cuts off its citizens from
  foreign journalism and political discussion, which helps it to spread anti-Western propaganda
  among the Locha people.

Hey, what's up? I got your message!  Gratz!  Now that you're inside the Lochan firewall, you can
access any of the sites they don't let the rest of the world see.  Don't just go messing around with
stuff randomly, though.

From what I can figure out from looking around on the internet, you should check out a site called
LChan.  It's Locha's version of a certain famous online bulletin board, and it's the best place to
find out some choice information on what's going on.

One problem, though.  All the really interesting stuff is gonna be on the private political
discussion boards.  The government only lets registered users view and post on those, so that it can
keep tabs on anyone who causes trouble.  No worries, though.  It just means you'll have to hack
their account system. :)

LChan Bulletin Board:
  The LChan bulletin board is an independent online forum for all of Locha.  It's the most
  permissive site allowed by the government; some say they allow it to exist to identify dissidents.
  It is difficult for outsiders to access the private boards.

Hey, what's up?  Yeah, so, my bad; I didn't think about how the whole private board would be in
Lochan and stuff.  But I've got good news!  I've got this friend, Charlie, and his mom just sent him
these awesome pastries; they've got, like, persimmon or something in them.  I don't know.  And I
asked him where they came from, and... but you don't want to hear the whole boring story, I bet.
I'll sum up.

Charlie's parents are from Locha.  They got out during the last big revolution attempt in '99. 
Charlie was just a kid, but he still speaks Lochan pretty good.  I had him take a look at the saved
board files you sent me.  You're gonna freak out.

Turns out there's this guy, Li Yolei, who posts on the board all the time.  He writes this blog
about Lochan politics.  He's a big believer in freedom, democracy, all that awesome comic-book
stuff.  The thing is, a week ago, he gets arrested by the government.  For treason and inciting
rebellion.  He's under house arrest right now, but the folks on the board think he's gonna get
executed pretty frickin' soon.

You gotta help him out.  Charlie was able to find out some info on the local police system.  You
gotta get in there and set up something that'll help you get Yolei free.

Oh, and Charlie totally got the pastry recipe from his mom, so you should try it.  I attached it.
These things are totally awesome. :)

once you've got the police under control, you should be able to help Li Yolei get out from his house
arrest.  Charlie got a message translated into Lochan that explains what's going on; we don't know
how good Yolei's English is.  Assuming he's willing to make the attempt, all you have to do is get
him some plane tickets to the US, which should be child's play.

We don't know if Yolei will go along with the whole thing, but we figure if he's gonna be executed,
he'll probably be willing to try anything.  All you have to do is get the message through; I figure
the best place to make sure he sees it is his home computer.

Be careful on this one.  This dude's life is at stake, you know?

House Arrest:
  The political blogger Li Yolei is currently under house arrest.  You can communicate with him by

Hey, what's up?  We got a message back from Li Yolei.  According to Charlie, he says he's willing to
try, but he needs to bring along a friend, Gadao Koi, who's been arrested along with him.  So you
need to get two tickets.  As soon as you're done, you'll use the virus you planted in the police
system to help them get out undetected.

You want to get two tickets from the city of Sochao to Los Angeles, with a connecting flight to
Charlotte, North Carolina.  That's where Charlie and me are.  We'll meet them at the airport and
they can crash on my couch.  Or something.

Be careful.  If the Lochan government hears about this, they'll be royally ticked off.  No worries,
though, right? :)

Sochao Airport Ticketing System:
  Now that Li Yolei has escaped his house arrest, you will need to crack the security of the Sochao
  Airport's passenger record system to provide him and his companion with tickets and permission to

LOS ANGELES

Representatives of the California branch of the Department of Homeland Security announced this
morning that they have apprehended two suspected terrorists entering LAX airport.  The two men, Li
Yolei and Gadao Koi, arrived on an international flight from the totalitarian island nation of
Locha.  They had tickets for a connecting flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, the second-largest
banking center in the United States.  DHS officials would not comment on any suspected plans to
commit terrorist acts.

Only yesterday, the U.S. State Department added Locha to their list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.
The nation has been associated with previous acts of political and economic terrorism.  According to
representatives of the Transportation Security Administration, officials became suspicious when it
was discovered that the two men's tickets had been fraudulently ordered.  The computer hacker
responsible for acquiring the tickets has so far eluded identification.

There has been no change in the Homeland Security Terror Alert Level in response to the arrests.

So, yeah, Charlie and me were pretty puzzled when Yolei and Koi didn't show up.  Then we read the

It's a detainment camp on one of the Florida Keys that they opened up when they closed down
Guantanamo Bay.

I know you probably don't want to stick your nose out any further.  But I kinda feel like we owe

have the skillz to get them out of Camp Zulu.

I got some info on the camp.  Looks like there are eight major systems you'll need to crack into in
order to get the guys out.  They can take a boat to Key West, and then take a bus to my place in
Charlotte.  The TSA doesn't give a crap about busses.

Hey, I know you don't want to get into trouble with DHS and Uncle Sugar, but if you're game, I'm

KEY WEST, FL

Twelve protesters were arrested today on Boca Chica Key in Florida, where they were protesting at
the gates of Naval Air Station Key West.  NAS Key West is the last stop for supplies before they are
sent to Camp Zulu, the United States' new controversial detention camp for suspected terrorists and
enemy combatants, built to replace the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

The protesters were members of a larger group protesting the treatment of prisoners at Camp Zulu,
including allegations of torture and suspension of detainees' habeas corpus rights.  The protesters
were arrested for trespassing when they crossed the ropes set up by the air station to contain the
demonstration.

WASHINGTON, DC

Congress entered its second day of hearings today on the subject of Camp Zulu, the government's
controversial replacement for the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.  The hearings were called to
address concerns over the administration's arrest of terrorism suspects with insufficient evidence
and their reluctance to allow prisoners access to proper legal counsel.

Representatives of the Department of Homeland Security testified that the criticized practices are
necessary in "these dangerous times."  They cited the August 25 arrest of two Lochan suspects as an
example of a necessary action to preserve the security of the United States.

Hey, what's up?  I thought you might wanna know what Charlie and I have been able to dig up about
our two new friends, what with you breaking them out of jail and all.  Li Yolei's a political
blogger, but his day job was working at the Historical Museum in Liao.  Seems he was born just after
the big 1974 coup, and his parents were a pair of college professors back before all the colleges
got shut down.  The BBC did a story on Li's museum a few years ago.  Seems the guys in charge of the
country replaced all the stuff having to do with kings and stuff with soldiery stuff, instead.
Swords and junk.  Anyway, I figure if you work in a history museum full of fake history, you'll want
to bitch about it to someone.

As for his friend, Gadao Koi, I don't really know much.  His parents were caught up in the failed
1999 revolution, but they were never anything big.  The only thing I could find on Gadao himself was
his arrest report in the local propaganda rag.  He was arrested last month for loitering and
sedition, which probably meant he was hanging out in a bar and said the wrong things to the wrong
people.  Regardless, he's Li's friend or something, and for some reason he was allowed to visit Li
during the whole house arrest thing.  Maybe they figured there wasn't any harm in it, or something.
Anyway, seems Gadao speaks pretty good English and is sort of an American culture buff.  We managed
to grab one of his suitcases at the baggage claim in Charlotte, and he had tourist stuff in it,
American clothes, that sort of thing.  I bet he'll be happy to be free!

Good luck with the rest of the cracking.  :)

LIOA, LOCHA

36 prisoners were executed today in a public exhibition by the Lochan government.  The event, which
took place in Lioa Football Stadium, was attended by 20,000 people, according to the Lochan Public
Information Department.  The prisoners were accused of various crimes, ranging from treason and
sedition to violation of the People's Secrets Act and inciting a riot.

The US State Department condemned the event in a public statement, claiming that "27 of the 36
prisoners were prisoners of conscience, imprisoned for speaking out against a corrupt and immoral
government.  None of the prisoners," read the statement, "were provided with fair trials, and [the
US State Department] has evidence that the prisoners were treated in a way which violates the United
Nations' Declaration of Human Rights."

The Lochan government responded with a speech by General Ko, one of the ruling council of Locha.  In
his public address, he accused the US government of "believing themselves to be exempt from their
own criticism" and ominously declared that "the corrupt and decadent United States will grow to regret
their attempts to exert control on other sovereign nations."  The US Department of Homeland Security
is currently holding two Lochan citizens under suspicion of conspiracy to commit acts of terror.

We dug a little deeper on Gadao last night after we got back to my place.  His parents were involved
in the '99 revolution, all right... on the government side.  They double-crossed the rebels,
actually were kinda the reason the revolution failed.  Charlie says Yolei had no clue his friend was
true-blue loyalist.

But that's where we are.  Screwed.  We got a Lochan agent wandering around Charlotte.  We already

In the meanwhile, a bunch of folks in the local hacker circle have noticed some weird stuff going
down.  Someone's been busy poking around at a bunch of important systems in town, checking them for
vulnerabilities.  It looks like Gadao's a security cracker, too.  But I've got a way to find him.

I lost my cell phone.  When we got home the night we picked up Li, I realized it wasn't in the
outside pocket of my bag where I always keep it.  I'm also missing a few bills from my wallet.  I
figure Gadao lifted the phone and the cash to get himself started.  The thing is that I hacked my

phone snaps a picture every hour.  What you gotta do is crack into the phone and get access to the
photos and to the GPS system.  That way, we can figure out where he is and what he's been doing.

called a junkyard, a delivery company... it doesn't fit together with what I'd expect a terrorist or
a spy to do.  He's been doing some sort of chemistry; one of the pictures the phone automatically
took seems to be of a blender full of a gray powder, with some aluminum foil nearby...

Holy crap.  I just realized what he's making.  Thermite.  Rust from old metal, aluminum powder from
foil... and, yeah, one of the pictures shows what could be a fireworks package, for ignition.  This
is really bad.  Thermite's easy to make -- I mean, I made some when I was, like, twelve -- and it
burns hot enough to melt, like, anything.  He could weld metal, set fire to stuff, open a jail cell...

We gotta figure out what he's planning to do with the thermite.  According to the GPS locator in my

a bunch of different servers around town.  Looks like our friend's a security cracker, too.  I'm
seeing intrusions at the Charlotte Fire Department and a major server for Ameribank.

You can figure out what sort of trouble he could cause at the fire department.  And Ameribank's a
big deal, too.  It's the biggest bank in Charlotte, and its headquarters are downtown.  Part of
Locha's propaganda has always been that we have corrupt capitalistic ways, so Ameribank's corporate
headquarters would be a perfect place for one of their agents to strike.

Now for the bad news.  My cell phone finally ran out of batteries.  We won't be able to track him as
easily from now on.  I did manage to get one last photo before the phone died.  It's out of focus
and really badly framed, but it looks like Gadao's in some sort of uniform.  I'm guessing he's
gotten a hold of a courier's uniform from the company he called yesterday.

You've got to do two things.  First, crack into the fire department and see if you can undo whatever
Gadao did.  Second, crack into the Swifty Couriers computer and see if you can find any unusual
activity there.  There might be evidence of cracking, or just signs that Gadao got a uniform the
old-fashioned way.  Maybe off of some guy's clothesline.  :)

Fire Department Dispatch System:
  Gadao Koi has cracked the Charlotte Fire Department's servers.  You must crack in and fix whatever
  he's done.

Hey, what's up?  Nicely done on that cleanup.  Looks like Gadao tried to mess with the fire department's
dispatch service, to screw up any calls they had in the uptown area.  I think you fixed it, but if
there had been a fire in central Charlotte, the trucks never would have gotten there in time.

It's kind of weird, actually.  A lot of the tricks he used were the same tricks you used to crack
into the Lochan police system a week ago.  Either he's copying what you did, or he's just got a
pretty similar style.  It might help keep the feds' attention off of you when this is all over.

With the fire department back online, we've got a little margin for error in case things go wrong.
We still need to figure out just what Gadao's planning to do with Ameribank, but it's got to be
something at their uptown headquarters.

We should be able to use the information from the courier service's computers to plan our next move.  :)

Swifty Couriers:
  Gadao Koi has a uniform of a courier that hand-delivers important packages to uptown Charlotte
  locations.  Earlier, he called the Swifty Couriers company.  Crack into their scheduling and
  inventory system to find out what's going on.

-----------------------------------

Hey, what's up?  I've taken a look through the courier service's scheduling system.  Looks like they
had a courier that went out on a gig and never came back yesterday.  They probably didn't think it
was weird; I've had some friends that worked for companies like that, and they were all slackers and
stuff.  It's like being a pizza delivery guy, except you can't eat the pizza if you get lost and
hungry.  Not that I ever did that or anything when I was doing pizza delivery.  That'd be uncool.

So, anyway, the last address the guy was supposed to deliver to was a cheap-ass hotel room.
Probably where Gadao spent the night.  Jump the courier, steal his outfit, do a little forgery to
put Gadao's photo on his ID badge.  Easy.  I just hope our friend tied him up in the closet instead
of killing him.

But we can't worry about that right now.  With a uniform and a badge from a real courier service,
Gadao's not gonna raise an eyebrow even if he wheels a whole handcart of stuff into the Ameribank
Building downtown.  Even if they test for explosives, they won't notice anything; since he's using
thermite, all they'll see is rust, aluminum, and magnesium.  And none of those'll trip any alarms.

We don't know exactly what he's going to do, but he's probably going to do it soon.  You've got to
crack into the Ameribank Building's security system once you're sure you've totally fixed whatever
Gadao did to the fire department computers.  Hopefully, we can get him on camera and stay one step
ahead of him.  :)

Ameribank Security System:
  With the fire department back online and the routing information from Swifty Couriers, you know
  that Gadao's planning to attack the headquarters of Ameribank.  Crack their security system to
  track Gadao on their security cameras.

-----------------------------------

Hey, what's up?  I'm connected to the cameras, and I just spotted Gadao coming into the building
with a big-ass bag.  He's gotta have at least twenty pounds of thermite in there, and it looks like
he's got it split up into totally not-suspicious packages.

Chances are, he's got strategic places he's gonna deliver them.  Maybe high-profile companies and
departments, maybe just really flammable areas.  Hell, if he wanted to he could probably melt right
through an elevator cable or a steel door.  I'm gonna try and keep an eye on him with the cameras,
and use the security communication system to report the packages as suspicious as soon as he drops
each one off.  We don't want to tip him off, or he might do something crazy.

I've got a different job for you, though.  I had a hunch, and checked on the status log that the
security system gets from the fire suppression system.  It looks like when he cracked into their
servers, he put a virus in the system.  If one of those packs of incendiaries goes off, it'll burn
unchecked.  No water, no foam, not even some guy blowing on it really hard.

Get into that fire supression system and get it working again.  I think we've almost got him beat!  :)

Ameribank Fire Suppression:
  Gadao Koi has infected the Ameribank Building fire suppression system with a virus that will
  prevent the sprinklers, fire doors, and alarms from functioning properly.  You must get through
  the virus's security to restart the system.

-----------------------------------

Hey, what's up?  We've got a runner!  The security folks found the first pack that Gadao dropped
off, and they've sounded an evacuation order.  From the chatter on the radios, it sounds like Gadao
has a timer set on each of the packages, and the rent-a-cops thought the one they found was a bomb.
Well, I guess they're not too far off.

Anyway, that means that Gadao knows they're on to him.  I've been following him on the cameras.
He's still got half his packages, and he's gone back into a maintenance area that's off-limits
during an evacuation.  He's heading for a service elevator that heads right for the parking garage
that's attached to the building.

From what I can see of the security, they're not going to check that area until it's waaaaay too
late.  So you've gotta stop him, or he's gonna get away.

The security system has a connection to the elevator routing computer.  You can crack into that and
stop his elevator between floors.  That way, he'll be stuck until the cops get there.  :)

Ameribank Building Elevators:
  Gadao Koi is attempting to escape via a service elevator that will take him directly to the parking
  deck of the building and bypass the approaching police.  You must stop the elevator and trap Koi.

Hey, what's up?  In case you haven't been watching the news, I figured I'd let you know how things
turned out after you trapped Gadao last night.

The news said that folks got out all right.  A couple of the packages went off before the firemen
could get to them, but no one was hurt too bad.  Apparently, one of them burned a hole through the
floor of some lawyer company's lobby, and another actually took out a room full of web servers.  No
big losses, though.

Good news for us: seems Gadao sent off a little manifesto to the papers just before his escapades,
ranting about how we Americans are all evil and stuff.  Anyway, he specifically dissed Li Yolei,
saying he was a traitor to Locha and how Li was just a tool that Gadao used to strike at the U.S.
It looks like the U.S. government is believing it, too; they've said that they're looking for Li to
grant him asylum.  Charlie and I should be able to work out a way to turn him over without them
suspecting us.

As for Gadao himself, well... it seems that he didn't want to be caught by the feds.  They say he
tried to cut his way out of the elevator using the thermite, and it... didn't work.  The whole
elevator was filled with flames.  They say there was nothing left of him but charred bones.
Hardcore.  I almost feel bad for him.

Anyway, this whole thing goes to show you that you totally shouldn't listen to any suggestions I
make.  Except one.  Try those persimmon pastries, really.  They're awesome.  :)

Talk to you later.
